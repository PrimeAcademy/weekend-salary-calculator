# PROJECT NAME
Employee Information & Monthly Expenses Calculator

## Description

Duration: 1.5 Week Sprint

We were asked to create a form which would take in employee information, including first and last name, ID number, position, and annual salary. This information is then stored and displayed in a table in the DOM.

We were asked to calculate total monthly expenditure. To calculate this, each employee's annual salary was divided by 12, then added together. If the total monthly expenditure was greater than $20,000, the amount is highlighed in red.
